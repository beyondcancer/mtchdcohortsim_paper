#mtchdcohortsim_paper:

To run full simulation: 
Run dofile: Do-Files/pipeline_phase1.do

Simulation reps: Stores do files to run the simulations (Currently split in one job per DGM)

Performance measures: Once estimates are obtained, use these dofiles to combine the datasets and calculate the performance estimates

Graphs: Outputs graphs to visualise the data


sim one_rep_v2: produces km graphs by exposure status, for a large 1 million sample of one base cohort by underlying timescale and for each different DGM (exposure prevalence and confounding level)
