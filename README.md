#mtchdcohortsim_paper:

To run full simulation: 
Run dofile: Do-Files/pipeline_phase1.do

Simulation reps: Stores do files to run the simulations (Currently split in one job per DGM)
Performance measures: Once estimates are obtained, use these dofiles to combine the datasets and calculate the performance estimates
Graphs: Outputs graphs to visualise the data
